# OpenAI

The following example outlines how to use OpenAI Function Calling and the Superface API.

If you want to run this example for yourself as a Jupyter Notebook, you can [download the `.ipynb` file](/notebooks/superface_agent_hub_openai_example.ipynb).

## Prerequisites

```python
pip install openai
```

## Setup

Import the dependencies, and setup the required constants.

```python
import openai
import json
import random
import requests as r
from openai import OpenAI
from IPython.display import display, Markdown

# Set a random number of your choice, but don't change it
# once you have run the notebook, otherwise you will create another user.
SUPERFACE_USER_ID_CONSTANT =

# Use the number to create a unique ID
SUPERFACE_USER_ID = "sfoaidemo|" + str(SUPERFACE_USER_ID_CONSTANT)

# Default URL for Superface
SUPERFACE_BASE_URL = "https://pod.superface.ai/api/hub"

# Set the Superface authentication token
SUPERFACE_AUTH_TOKEN="<your-superface-auth-token>"

# Set the OpenAI API Key
OPENAI_API_KEY="<your-open-api-key>"
```

## OpenAI setup

Next, set up the basis of the OpenAI SDK including which model to use. The system prompt below can be changed, but it is worth including if you have space for it to ensure that the prompts returned by Superface's API are handled correctly in context.

```python
# OpenAI Config
client = OpenAI(api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)
GPT_MODEL = "gpt-4-turbo-preview"
INIT_INSTRUCTIONS = """
You are a helpful assistant.
Respond to the following prompt by using function_call and then summarize actions.
Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous.
Display the agent_hint from the response to the user if it is present.
"""
```

## Helper functions

Below, we have defined two helper functions.

- The first gets the list of available tools from your Superface account using the [`/fd`](../endpoints) endpoint.
- The second performs the action that the LLM selects using the [`/perform`](../endpoints#perform) endpoint.

These helpers are for example purposes and you are welcome to build different ways to approach these in whatever manner you choose.

```python
# Helper function to return the tool function descriptors
def get_superface_tools():
  headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer "+ SUPERFACE_AUTH_TOKEN}
  tools = r.get(SUPERFACE_BASE_URL + "/fd", headers=headers)
  return tools.json()

# Helper function to perform the action for all the functions.
# This is the only API call required regardless of what the function is.
def perform_action(tool_name=None, tool_body=None):
  headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer "+ SUPERFACE_AUTH_TOKEN, "x-superface-user-id": SUPERFACE_USER_ID}
  perform = r.post(SUPERFACE_BASE_URL + "/perform/" + tool_name, headers=headers, json=tool_body)
  return json.dumps(perform.json())

# Helper function for calling the OpenAI Chat Completions API
def perform_chat_request(messages, tools=None, tool_choice=None, model=GPT_MODEL):
  try:
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
      model=model,
      messages=messages,
      tools=tools,
      tool_choice=tool_choice,
    )
    return response
  except Exception as e:
    print("Unable to generate ChatCompletion response")
    print(f"Exception: {e}")
    return e
```

## Prompt

```python
# User prompt - The weather tool requires no authentication
prompt = "What is the weather in Prague?"
```

## Passing functions to OpenAI

The code below represents starting a new chat session, similar to when you first load ChatGPT.

- The `system` prompt is loaded first to instruct the LLM on how to handle any further messages.
- The initial user prompt is defined as the subsequent message
- The system prompt, the user prompt, and the list of function definitions from Superface are passed over to the LLM

```python
messages = []
messages.append({"role": "system", "content": INIT_INSTRUCTIONS})

messages.append({
  "role": "user",
  "content": prompt
})

chat_response = perform_chat_request(
  messages, tools=get_superface_tools()
)
```

## Perform function call

The OpenAI LLM responds with a decision that it needs to use a function to complete the task in the user's prompt. Good news though, you passed in a list of function definitions and it has selected one (or perhaps multiple) that seems appropriate to do it.

```python
assistant_message = chat_response.choices[0].message
messages.append(assistant_message)

# Uncomment assistant_message if you want to see the response from OpenAI
#assistant_message

tool_calls = assistant_message.tool_calls

if (assistant_message.tool_calls):

# Assistant wants to call a tool, run it

for tool_call in tool_calls:
function_name = tool_call.function.name
function_args = json.loads(tool_call.function.arguments)
function_response = perform_action(function_name, function_args)
#print(function_response)

    messages.append(
      {
        "tool_call_id": tool_call.id,
        "role": "tool",
        "name": function_name,
        "content": function_response,
      }
    )

    second_chat_response = perform_chat_request(messages, tools=get_superface_tools())
    #print(second_chat_response)

    if second_chat_response.choices[0].message.content:
      display(Markdown(second_chat_response.choices[0].message.content))
```

## Final response

The final response will be something similar to:

```text
The current weather in Prague, Czech Republic is partly cloudy with a temperature of 13°C, and it feels like 13°C.
```

## Summary

The code shown here is basic example of how to set up OpenAI to accept a prompt and, using the supplied function defintions, decide which function is appropriate to use.

Almost all of the code could be written differently, so it's up to you how you want to approach building the right elements into your agent.

At a minimum, you need:

- A way to retrieve the function definitions from the `/fd` endpoint
- A way to create a user session using the `/session` endpoint
- A way to execute the selected function using the `/perform` endpoint
