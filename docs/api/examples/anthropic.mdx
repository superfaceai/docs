# Anthropic

Anthropic are building a series of Large Language Models under the name Claude. In this example we show how to use their approach to [function calls and tools](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/tool-use) (currenly in Beta).

The tool function definitions and execution of the API calls for the selected tool(s) is handled by Superface using the [Hub API endpoints](../endpoints). The choice of which tool to use, and other decision making is handled by Claude.

You can download this example as a [runnable .ipynb notebook](/notebooks/superface_hub_api_anthropic_weather_example.ipynb).

## Prerequisites

The Anthropic Python SDK is required for this example.

```python
pip install anthropic
```

## Setup

Import the dependencies and configure the required constants. Some of these, such as those relating to the `SUPERFACE_USER_ID` are for example purposes. In a production environment you would handle this differenly, as outlined in the [Session Management guide](../sessions).

```python
import anthropic
import json
import requests as r
from IPython.display import display, Markdown

# Set a random number of your choice, but don't change it
# once you have run the notebook, otherwise you will create another user.
SUPERFACE_USER_ID_CONSTANT =

# Use the number to create a unique ID
SUPERFACE_USER_ID = "sfclaudedemo|" + str(SUPERFACE_USER_ID_CONSTANT)

# Default URL for Superface
SUPERFACE_BASE_URL = "https://pod.superface.ai/api/hub"

# Set the Superface authentication token
SUPERFACE_API_TOKEN="<your-superface-api-token>"

# Set the OpenAI API Key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="<your-anthropic-api-key>"
```

## Anthropic Setup

To initialize the Anthropic SDK, pass in your API key.

```python
client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
```

## Helper functions

There are a lot of repetitive tasks when dealing with LLMs so having some helper functions to cut down on code helps. First we define two helpers to use with Superface's Hub API.

```python
# Helper function to return the tool function descriptors
def get_superface_tools():
    headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer "+ SUPERFACE_AUTH_TOKEN}
    tools = r.get(SUPERFACE_BASE_URL + "/fd", headers=headers)
    return tools.json()

# Helper function to perform the action for all the functions.
# This is the only API call required regardless of what the function is.
def perform_action(tool_name=None, tool_body=None):
    headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer "+ SUPERFACE_AUTH_TOKEN, "x-superface-user-id": SUPERFACE_USER_ID}
    perform = r.post(SUPERFACE_BASE_URL + "/perform/" + tool_name, headers=headers, json=tool_body)
    return json.dumps(perform.json())
```

The first function, `get_superface_tools()`, retrieves the function descriptions for any tools that have been added in your Superface account. At the very least, you'll already have the Wttr.in tool that this example uses.

The second function, `perform_action()`, is responsible for executing the API request for the tool and specific function that Claude will choose. It also ensures that this request is authenticated as a specific user using the `x-superface-user-id` header.

### Transform function descriptions

The JSON schema for defining tools that Anthropic requires is _slightly_ different to that used by OpenAI, MistraAI and LangChain. To account for this, the helper function below reformats the JSON response from `get_superface_tools()`.

```python
def get_formatted_tools():
    original_tools = get_superface_tools()
    formatted_tools = []

    for tool in original_tools:
    formatted_tools.append(tool['function'])

    for tool in formatted_tools:
    tool['input_schema'] = tool.pop("parameters")

    return formatted_tools
```

The final helper is to communicate with Claude. This is also where the model selection, initial system prompt, list of tools and message history are set up.

```python

def talk_to_claude(role=None, message=None):
    messages.append({"role": role, "content": message})
    response = client.beta.tools.messages.create(
        model="claude-3-opus-20240229",
        max_tokens=1024,
        system="Today is April 5, 2024",
        tools=get_formatted_tools(),
        messages=messages
    )
    return response
```

## Message history

This example needs a "memory" of all the interactions between the user, the API and Claude. An array is a good way to do this:

```python
messages = []
```

## Prompt

Next, set up the initial user prompt. Asking about the weather is the most simplistic example you can do but it's also the example that Anthropic use for their [function calling documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/tool-use) so we've mirrored that here to help you compare.

```python
response = talk_to_claude("user", "What's the weather like in Prague?")
print(response)
```

## What is Claude thinking?

Claude likes to think. The first response to a user prompt will contain what Claude thinks the best approach is for obtaining the result. It can vary slightly depending on the amount of inputs a tool expects.

```text
<thinking>
To get the current weather forecast for Prague, I should use the weather__current-weather__CurrentWeather function. Let's check if I have the required parameters:

city: The user provided "Prague" as the city. To be more precise, I'll specify "Prague, Czech Republic".
units: This is an optional parameter. The user did not specify units, so I can omit this and the function will use the default of Celsius.

I have the required city parameter, so I can proceed with calling the function.
</thinking>
```

Additionally, as part of the response Claude will provide the name of the selected tool, and the required inputs so that a call to the Superface Hub API can be made.

## Perform function call

If Claude wants to use a tool (which is this case is true), add the last response to the message history, then extract the function name, and the inputs and use the `perform_action()` helper to pass them to the Hub API.

```python
if (response.content[1] and response.content[1].type == "tool_use"):
  claude_response = response.content[1]
  messages.append({
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": [
          {
              "type": "text",
              "text": response.content[0].text
          },
          {
              "type": claude_response.type,
              "id": claude_response.id,
              "name": claude_response.name,
              "input": claude_response.input
          }
      ]
  })

  function_name = claude_response.name
  function_inputs = claude_response.input
  tool_use_id = claude_response.id

  superface_response = perform_action(function_name, function_inputs)

superface_response
```

The response from Superface in this instance will look similar to this:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "assistant_hint": "Format the result in 'result' field to the user. If the user asked for a specific format, respect it",
  "result": {
    "description": "Partly cloudy",
    "feelsLike": 16,
    "temperature": 16
  }
}
```

## Final response

Now that the Hub API has executed the function and returned a result, this needs to be added to the message history and sent back to Claude to determine a final response.

```python
tool_response_content = [{
    "type": "tool_result",
    "tool_use_id": tool_use_id,
    "content": superface_response

}]
claude_response = talk_to_claude("user", tool_response_content)
```

Claude will reply with the final response which can also be added to the message history:

```python
messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": claude_response.content[0].text})
```

In notebook form, this can be displayed nicely to the user:

```python
display(Markdown(claude_response.content[0].text))
```

```text
Current weather in Prague, Czech Republic: Temperature: 16°C Feels like: 16°C Description: Partly cloudy
```

## Summary

This example builds on the function calling example that Anthropic use, however, with Superface's Hub API you can access many varied APIs, including your own custom tools.

The approach to implementing those would be similar, especialy when you consider that just a single function is required to execute any of the functions an LLM selects and Superface will handle it from there.
