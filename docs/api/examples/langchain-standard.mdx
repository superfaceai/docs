# LangChain (Tool Calling)

The Superface tool function descriptions are available as JSON schema that follows the OpenAI tool definition. Although this format is common amongst other LLMs, there are some slight differences depending on the model you choose to use.

LangChain have tooling that standarizes how functions are passed to LLMs, as well as how the response from the model is handled, regardless of the model you want to use.

Using LangChain is our recommended approach if you are using LLMs such as Anthropic, Cohere or Gemini Pro.

## Example breakdown

To begin working with LangChain, the core package must be installed.

```bash
pip install langchain
```

You will also need to install the wrapper for the API of the LLM that you want to use. For example, with Anthropic:

```bash
pip install langchain-anthropic
```

### Setup

Then setup the necessary packages:

```python
import json
import requests as r
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage
```

### Helper function

A helper function is required to retrieve the function descriptions for the tools that have been added to your Superface account. You can read more about the `fd` endpoint in our [Endpoints documentation](../endpoints).

```python
SUPERFACE_BASE_URL = "https://pod.superface.ai/api/hub"
SUPERFACE_AUTH_TOKEN="<your-superface-auth-token>"

def get_superface_tools():
  headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer "+ SUPERFACE_AUTH_TOKEN}
  tools = r.get(SUPERFACE_BASE_URL + "/fd", headers=headers)
  return tools.json()
```

### LLM setup

Next, set up the LLM you want to use (in this example we use [Anthropic's Claude 3 Opus](https://www.anthropic.com/claude)):

```python
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic

llm = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-opus-20240229", temperature=0, api_key=ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
```

Then bind the tools from Superface to the LLM using the helper function and LangChains `bind_tools` function:

```python
tools = get_superface_tools()
llm_anthropic = llm.bind_tools(tools)
```

### Invoke the query

Finally, set up a query and invoke it along with the selection of tools.

```python
query = "What is the weather in Prague?"
result_anthropic = llm_anthropic.invoke(query)
result_anthropic
```

The result will be output as:

```python
AIMessage(content=[{'text': '<thinking>\nThe user is asking for the current weather in Prague. The relevant tool is weather__current-weather__CurrentWeather, which takes the required parameter "city" and an optional "units" parameter.\n\nThe user directly provided the city name "Prague", so we have the value for the required "city" parameter. \n\nThe optional "units" parameter was not provided, but that is okay since it will default to Celsius if not specified.\n\nSince we have the required parameter, we can proceed with the API call.\n</thinking>', 'type': 'text'}, {'id': 'toolu_012DorWutbzM3Nf64TvHergT', 'input': {'city': 'Prague, Czech Republic'}, 'name': 'weather__current-weather__CurrentWeather', 'type': 'tool_use'}], response_metadata={'id': 'msg_01TnL7gHzLhC4FXWhNP6rdRY', 'model': 'claude-3-opus-20240229', 'stop_reason': 'tool_use', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'input_tokens': 577, 'output_tokens': 176}}, id='run-8e283a7d-8a3f-4ea6-9a8a-c19ba68a413e-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'weather__current-weather__CurrentWeather', 'args': {'city': 'Prague, Czech Republic'}, 'id': 'toolu_012DorWutbzM3Nf64TvHergT'}])
```

### Find the tool calls

It is possible to extract the tool calls array from this response so that your agent/application can run them using [Superface's `/perform` endpoint](../endpoints).

```python
result_anthropic.tool_calls
```

Results in:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "weather__current-weather__CurrentWeather",
    "args": { "city": "Prague, Czech Republic" },
    "id": "toolu_012DorWutbzM3Nf64TvHergT"
  }
]
```

## Using different LLMs

So, what would you need to change to use Superface and LangChain with a different LLM? Only the LLM setup needs to be different. Here is how it would change from Anthropic, to Cohere, or Gemini Pro:

### Anthropic

```python
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
llm = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-opus-20240229", temperature=0, api_key=ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
```

### Cohere

```python
from langchain_cohere import ChatCohere
llm = ChatCohere(model="command-r", temperature=0, api_key=COHERE_API_KEY)
```

### Gemini Pro

```python
from langchain_google_vertexai import ChatVertexAI
llm = ChatVertexAI(model_name="gemini-pro", temperature=0, convert_system_message_to_human=True, api_key=VERTEXAI_API_KEY)
```

:::note Usage with create_tool_calling_agent
Currently, LangChain's `create_tool_calling_agent` for building agents that take advantage of their standardized tool formatting will not work directly with the JSON response from the `/fd` endpoint Superface provides.

Tools defined with JSON must be converted to a Python dict that inherits from their BaseTool class in order to work correctly.
