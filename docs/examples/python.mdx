# Python

In this example, we will go over the steps required to implement Superface into your Python application development workflow.

:::info Have you created Comlinks?

This guide assumes that you have already
installed and run the Superface CLI to generate the Comlinks for the API
integration you want to work with. If not, please [start
here](../introduction/quick-start.mdx).

### Install OneSDK

```shell
pip install...
```

Finally, create a new file called `main.py`, or open whichever file you want to include your integration code in.

### (Optional) Move your Comlinks

If you created your Comlinks with the Superface CLI in a different folder, please move them to a `superface` folder at the root of your application. The following files are expected by OneSDK.

```text
.
└── superface/ - directory with all the Comlinks in project root
    ├── <profileScope>.<profileName>.profile - profile file
    ├── <providerName>.provider.json - provider file
    ├── <profileScope>.<profileName>.<providerName>.map.js - map file
    └── ... - repeat for all the Comlinks
```

### Add the OneSDK function

```python title="main.py"
from superfaceai.one_sdk import OneClient

client = OneClient(
    assets_path = "./superface",
    superface_api_url = "https://superface.dev",
    token = "sfs_x"
)

profile = client.get_profile("wasm-sdk/example")
use_case = profile.get_usecase("Example")
try:
    r = use_case.perform(
        { "id": 1 },
        provider = "localhost",
        parameters = { "PARAM": "parameter_value" },
        security = { "basic_auth": { "username": "username", "password": "password" } }
    )
    print(f"RESULT: {r}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"ERROR: {e}")
```

### Run the code

```shell
python main.py
```
