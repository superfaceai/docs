# Python

In this example, we will go over the steps required to implement Superface into your Python application development workflow.

:::info Have you created Comlinks?

This guide assumes that you have already
installed and run the [Superface CLI](../introduction/quick-start.mdx) to generate the Comlinks for the API
integration you want to work with. If not, please [start
here](../introduction/quick-start.mdx).

### Install OneSDK

```shell
python -m pip install one-sdk
```

Finally, create a new file called `__main__.py`, or open whichever file you want to include your integration code in.

### (Optional) Move your Comlinks

If you created your Comlinks with the Superface CLI in a different folder, please move them to a `superface` folder at the root of your application. The following files are expected by OneSDK.

```text
.
└── superface/ - directory with all the Comlinks in project root
    ├── <profileScope>.<profileName>.<providerName>.map.js
    ├── <profileScope>.<profileName>.profile
    ├── <providerName>.provider.json
    └── ...repeat for all the Comlinks
```

### Add the OneSDK function

```python title="__main__.py"
import sys

from one_sdk import OneClient, PerformError, UnexpectedError

client = OneClient()

profile = client.get_profile("<profileName>")
use_case = profile.get_usecase("<usecaseName>")
try:
    r = use_case.perform(
        {
            # Input parameters as defined in profile:
            '<key>': '<value>'
        },
        provider = '<providerName>',
        # Provider specific integration parameters:
        parameters = {
            '<integrationParameterName>': '<integrationParameterValue>'
        },
        security = {
            # Provider specific security values:
            '<securityValueId>': {
                # Security values as described in provider or on profile page
            }
        }
    )
    print(f"RESULT: {r}")
except PerformError as e:
    print(f"ERROR RESULT: {e.error_result}")
except UnexpectedError as e:
    print(f"ERROR: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
except Exception as e:
    raise e
finally:
    client.send_metrics_to_superface()
```

### Run the code

```shell
python __main.py__
```
