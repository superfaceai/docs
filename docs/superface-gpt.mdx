## Authentication

You will need to provide your own authentication for any of the tools you want to use. The flow for that authentication works like this:

1. You write a prompt that uses one of the tools provided by Superface.
2. Superface will respond with a message asking you to configure the tool by logging in, or providing your own API key.

3. This will open a new window for the secure authentication service that Superface provides.

You can now confirm that the required authentication is in place and your original prompt will be attempted again.

Superface uses a temporary ID provided by OpenAI to recognize you. This ID is valid for up to 24 hours, but can expire at any time. If the ID expires, you will be asked to re-authenticate.
