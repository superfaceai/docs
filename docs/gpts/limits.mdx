# Limitations

When using Superface with your GPT you may encounter an error similar to this:

![The GPT usage cap for GPT-4 error](/img/gpts/gpt-usagecap-error.png)

GPT-4 is currently limited to ~50 messages in a 3 hour window. Unfortunately, this limit is set by OpenAI and is not something that Superface can control.

Your usage limit will typically reset after 2 hours, after which you will be able to continue using your GPT.

:::note

This limitation is specific to custom GPTs where the model is already decided. In standard ChatGPT chats, the model will switch to GPT-3.5 if the GPT-4 limit is reached.
