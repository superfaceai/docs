# Introduction

‚ö°Ô∏è Superface will help you quickly use and manage integrations, so that you can focus on developing your application.

üí∏ Developing integrations over and over is expensive. Use integrations developed by others, just as you'd use npm packages or crates.

üîê You data is safe, Superface isn't a proxy nor a middle-man.

üéì This approach gives you a framework to decouple the lifecycle of your application and the integrations it uses.

üí• Ready for more? Use advanced features like [provider failover](./guides/using-multiple-providers.mdx#failover) and [monitoring](./guides/integrations-monitoring.mdx).

üßê Superface is a language and a protocol for abstracting integrations as application use cases. It allows use case discovery and distribution of integration code at runtime.

## Fast track ‚è±Ô∏è

The easiest way to start is with [OneSDK](https://github.com/superfaceai/one-sdk-js) for Node.js and with an existing [use-case](./reference//glossary.md#use-case). Let's say you want to see what repositories Superface has on GitHub.

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and create a new project with [OneSDK](https://github.com/superfaceai/one-sdk-js):

```shell
mkdir my_project
cd my_project
npm init -y
npm install --save @superfaceai/one-sdk
```

Install `vcs/user-repos` [profile](./reference/glossary#profile) and configure `GitHub` as a [provider](./reference/glossary#provider):

```shell
npx @superfaceai/cli install vcs/user-repos --providers github
```

Create `index.js` file, and insert the following code:

```js
const { SuperfaceClient } = require('@superfaceai/one-sdk');

const sdk = new SuperfaceClient();

async function run() {
  // Load the installed profile
  const profile = await sdk.getProfile('vcs/user-repos');

  // Use the profile
  const result = await profile.getUseCase('UserRepos').perform({
    user: 'superfaceai',
  });

  return result.unwrap();
}

run();
```

Run it:

```shell
node index.js
```
