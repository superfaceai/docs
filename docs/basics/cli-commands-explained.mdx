# CLI commands explained

The Superface CLI is the starting point for every use case you define, this guide presents an overview of all the commands, what they do and what files they create.

If you don't have the CLI installed yet, you can do so with the commands below. If you aren't on macOS, or you don't use Homebrew, you'll need Node.js version 18 or higher to use it.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="macos"
  values={[
    { label: 'macOS', value: 'macos' },
    { label: 'Linux', value: 'linux' },
    { label: 'Windows', value: 'windows' },
  ]
}>

<TabItem value="macos">

```shell title="Install with Homebrew"
brew install superfaceai/cli/superface
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="linux">

```shell title="Install with NPM"
npm install -g @superfaceai/cli@latest
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows">

```shell title="Install with NPM"
npm install -g @superfaceai/cli@latest
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

After installing the CLI, the first command you should run is:

## `superface login`

Authenticates the CLI with your Superface account so that you can use the Superface AI engine to create and store your Comlink profiles, as well as track metrics around their usage.

## `superface prepare`

The `prepare` command will index the documentation for further AI processing.

It expects either a URL or file path to an [Open API Specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html) document for the API you want to work with.

It will pass the documentation to the Superface AI which will extract key information to create a [Comlink provider](/docs/basics/what-are-comlinks):

- The base URL
- Any parameters required to make an API request
- What security scheme is required

**File created:**

`superface/<api-name>.provider.json`

A new directory named `superface` will be created at this point, there you will find the first file the CLI creates; the `provider.json`.

## `superface new`

The `new` command creates a new comlink for a provider based on a natural language query provided ny you.

It is used when you are ready to define the use case you want to achieve with an API. For example:

`superface new resend "send an email"`

This command will instruct the Superface AI to look through the documentation you supplied and to work out what requests need to be made in order to achieve your use case. The output will be a Profile file, written in the Comlink language that describes the inputs, outputs and error responses the use case requries.

**File created:**

`superface/<profile-name>.profile`

This Comlink profile is completely abstracted from the API, because of this, it can be used with multiple providers of the same type of service.

## `superface map`

The `map` command maps a Comlink profile to an API provider.

It takes the Comlink profile (generated by `superface new`) and your chosen provider, and creates a code template for the API execution of the use case you specified. This is called a Map, and is required later on by the Superface OneSDK.

By default this command will generate Node.js output. If you want Python instead, you can add `python` to the end of the command.

**Files created:**

`superface/<profile-name>.map.js`

`superface/<profile-name>.<provider>.mjs` or `.py`

`superface/.env`

Additionally to the map, `.mjs` and `.env` will also be created. `.env` is a convenience file for environment variables that you will need to use, such as API keys or tokens.

The `.mjs` file is a runnable code example that demonstrates how to incorporate the Comlink files, and OneSDK into your application. It is also used for testing by the following command.

## `superface execute`

`execute` will run the example application created by the CLI to test the Comlink.

It is best used to test the use case implementation for any errors. It expects a provider, and a profile as inputs and will run them with OneSDK.

:::warning This command makes real requests
The `execute` command will run a use case against the target API, so be careful to use non-production data when testing.
:::

The `execute` command requires an additional `python` paramter at the end of the command in order to execute Python.

## `superface whoami`

Displays the user account currently logged into the CLI.

## `superface logout`

Will log the current user out of the CLI.

## `--help`

Detailed documentation is available when using the CLI by passing the `--help` command as a flag to any of the above commands.
