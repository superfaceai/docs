# Slack

In this example, we will show you how you can get started working with the [Slack API](https://developers.notion.com) to produce a working use case that allows you to list all of the users in your Slack workspace. Here we are using an endpoint from Slack's [Web API](https://api.slack.com/web) that requires a more minimal level of authentication.

:::info Before you start

You'll need a Slack API token that is valid for the workspace you want to access. Find out how to set that up in their [Getting a token](https://api.slack.com/tutorials/tracks/getting-a-token) guide.

### Install & Authorize Superface

Start by insalling the Superface CLI. You can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for this.

```shell
brew install superface
```

If you don't have a Superface account already, you can [sign up here](https://superface.ai/create-account). You can use your account to authenticate the CLI.

```shell
superface login
```

### Prepare the documentation

The Slack documentation is available in OAS format. You can find the Open API Specs for their APIs on the [Slack GitHub](https://github.com/slackapi/slack-api-specs/tree/master/web-api). Here we are using the OAS for their [Web API](https://api.slack.com/web).

```shell
superface prepare https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slackapi/slack-api-specs/master/web-api/slack_web_openapi_v2.json
```

Once the documentation has been indexed, you can create a profile for the use case you want to achieve.

```shell
superface new slack-web "list all users"
```

### Create code for your project

To turn the profile into the JavaScript map and boilerplate code, run the following command and include the name of the provider.

```shell
superface map slack-web
```

### Test it

:::note Don't forget your authentication

Superface expects an authorization token for Notion. You can add this as `SLACK_TOKEN` in your environment. To learn more how to handle API credentials, see [Setting provider API keys](../guides/api-keys.md).

:::

The resulting code from the previous step is added to the `superface` folder in your project. To test it you can use the `execute` command.

```shell
superface execute superface/<scope>.<profile-name>.<provider-name>.mjs
```

If everything is successful you will see a JSON response listing the users in your workspace.
