# Integrations monitoring

Superface comes with out-of-the-box monitoring of integrations used by your App. With Superface project you will get insights on your App's API dependencies and their health status. In case of use-case failure, you will also receive an email notification with details about the failing API calls.

## Set up integrations monitoring

This guide assumes you have created a Node.js app with first integration. If you missed that, see the previous step: [Getting&nbsp;started](./getting-started.mdx)

Copy the project's SDK token.

### Use the SDK token with your Application

In command line, set the token as `SUPERFACE_SDK_TOKEN` environment variable:

```shell
export SUPERFACE_SDK_TOKEN="<your token>"
```

Run your application again:

```shell
node index.js
```
