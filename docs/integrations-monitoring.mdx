# Integrations monitoring

Superface comes with out-of-the-box monitoring of integrations used by your App. With Superface project you will get insights on your App's API dependencies and their health status. In case of use-case failure, you will also receive an email notification with details about the failing API calls.

This guide assumes you have created a Node.js app with first integration. If you missed that, see the previous step: [Getting&nbsp;Started](./getting-started.mdx)
