# How to setup local environment

This document guides you through the installation and basic configuration of components needed to create own API integration, so that you can publish it, or use it locally in your application.

## Prerequisites

To install and use Superface CLI, you will need to have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/learn/how-to-install-nodejs) version 12 or higher, and `npm`.

## Install the CLI

The Superface CLI is a Node.js application. It provides all the tooling needed to author and manage your integrations with Superface.

```shell
npm install --global @superfaceai/cli
```

## Create a new project

:::note

If you have OpenAPI specification of the API you want to integrate you can use [Interactive designer](./interactive-designer) to bootstrap the project.

:::

Start with creating a new directory for the project

```shell
mkdir my_project
cd my_project
```

Optionally create `package.json` by running the following command:

```shell
npm init
```

Now initialize Superface local folder structure in the project root.

```shell
superface init
```

It will create `superface` folder with superface configuration file `super.json`.

And as last step install [OneSDK](/reference/one-sdk).

```shell
npm install --save @superfaceai/one-sdk
```

## (Optional) Install the Visual Studio Code extension

You can install the Visual Code Code extension which will give you:

- Syntax highlighting for [Comlink](/comlink)
- Code snippets

It can be installed from [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=superfaceai.superface-language-client-vscode).
