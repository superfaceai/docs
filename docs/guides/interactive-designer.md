# Interactive designer

[Interactive designer](https://superface.ai/designer) helps with bootstraping your API integration from OpenAPI specification.

Interactive designer allows you to select API endpoint and generate Comlink profile, provider and map. You can test the integration directly in the interactive designer and publish the API integration to Superface catalog.

Once published to Superface catalog you can download the generated project with Comlink profile, provider and map source files.
