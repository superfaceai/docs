# Debugging OneSDK

Understanding the types of communication and errors you might see when running an application using OneSDK is key to maintaing a fast workflow with Superface.

Below is a list of all the debugging options available in OneSDK and what you can use each one for.

## Using environment variables

You can set the debug level for OneSDK via your environment. There are two options and you can use one or both of them at the same time.

### ONESDK_LOG

```shell
ONESDK_LOG=on # on, yes, true, 1
```

`ONESDK_LOG` controls basic logging for OneSDK lifecycle and HTTP transactions logging.

## Setting debug options at runtime

You can also pass these variables to your application at runtime. For example:

```shell
ONESDK_LOG=on node index.mjs
```

You can also provide this option when using the CLI during the `execute` command:

```shell
ONESDK_LOG=on superface execute <provider-name> <scope/use-case>
```
