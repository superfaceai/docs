# Test & run new capability

## Setup

This guide assumes you have a project set up with Superface installed. If you need to set up a new project, please reference the [Setup Guide](#todo).

### Prerequisites

- Existing [profile](#todo)
- Existing [provider definition](#todo)
- Existing [map between profile & the provider](#todo)
- [Superface CLI](#todo) installed
- [Superface OneSDK](#todo) installed

## Compile Comlink documents

Comlink is a simple description and integration language that is designed to be interpreted in any programming language by using the respective SDK. In order for the SDK to understand the operations defined in Comlink, it needs to be compiled.

This is currently done manually<sup>\*</sup> using Superface CLI:

```shell
superface compile ./path/to-profile.supr
superface compile ./path/to-map.provider.suma
```

_Running the above commands will create `*.ast.json` files next to the original Profile & Map. You should leave these files in their place._

> Note: You have to recompile the profile or the map every time you make changes to them.

<sub>* The compilation will happen automatically in a future release of OneSDK. You won't have to compile manually using CLI.</sub>

## Configure provider authentication {#configure-security}

:::info Optional

If the Provider JSON doesn't define any _security schemes_, or the map doesn't use `security`, you can skip this step.

:::

If you've created a completely new Provider JSON definition in your project, it will not have its security schemes configured in the local `superface/super.json` configuration file.

Provider's security schemes must be configured in `super.json` since OneSDK will search for it when authenticating the requests during use case perform.

The specific provider section will look like the following example:

```json title="superface/super.json" {6-8}
{
  "profiles": {
    // ...
  },
  "providers": {
    "<provider-name>": {
      "security": []
    }
  }
}
```

_Search in top-level `providers` object for the actual provider you want to configure._

### Configure using CLI {#cli-configuration}

The easiest way to bootstrap the provider's security configuration is using [Superface CLI](#todo).

```shell
superface configure <path-to.provider.json> -p <profile-name> -l -f   
```

_Replace the `<path-to.provider.json>` in the command with the actual provider you're trying to configure for some `<profile-name>`._

Running the above command automatically creates security schemes configuration in `super.json` based on Provider definition. It also prepares expected environment variables (if any are required) inside a `.env` file.

_Advanced users can [configure the security manually](#manual-configuration) instead._

### Configure security in `super.json` manually {#manual-configuration}

_If you configured security [using CLI](#cli-configuration), you can skip this._

<details>
  <summary>Configuring security manually</summary>

You'll need to provide a configuration based on the security scheme type. Currently the following schemes can be used:

- [Configure Basic Auth](#basic-auth)
- [Configure Bearer Token](#bearer-token)
- [Configure API key in header or query](#api-key)

#### Reading environment variables in `super.json` {#envs}

You can be prepend any value assigned in `super.json` with a dollar sign (`$`) to reference an environment variable.

```json
{
  // ...
  "token": "$PROVIDER_API_TOKEN",
  // ...
}
```

_When evaluating the above configuration, OneSDK will look for `PROVIDER_API_TOKEN` value in environment variables._

#### Configure Basic Auth scheme {#basic-auth}

Use the following config and reference an existing security scheme from the Provider's JSON definition by an identifier.

```json title="superface/super.json" {8-12}
{
  "profiles": {
    // ...
  },
  "providers": {
    "<provider-name>": {
      "security": [
        {
          "id": "<scheme-id>",
          "username": "$PROVIDER_USERNAME", // will read `PROVIDER_USERNAME` from environment
          "password": "$PROVIDER_PASSWORD" // will read `PROVIDER_PASSWORD` from environment
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

_Replace `<scheme-id>` with the actual security scheme ID defined in the Provider JSON document. You can use your own values for `username` & `password`. However it's a common practice to supply these values via [environment variables](#envs)._

#### Configure Bearer Token scheme {#bearer-token}

Use the following config and reference an existing security scheme from the Provider's JSON definition by an identifier.

```json title="superface/super.json" {8-11}
{
  "profiles": {
    // ...
  },
  "providers": {
    "<provider-name>": {
      "security": [
        {
          "id": "<scheme-id>",
          "token": "$PROVIDER_API_TOKEN" // will read `PROVIDER_API_TOKEN` from environment
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

_Replace `<scheme-id>` with the actual security scheme ID defined in the provider JSON document. You can use your own value for `token`. However it's a common practice to supply these via [environment variables](#envs)._

#### Configure API key in headers or query {#api-key}

Use the following config and reference an existing security scheme from the Provider's JSON definition by an identifier.

```json title="superface/super.json" {8-11}
{
  "profiles": {
    // ...
  },
  "providers": {
    "<provider-name>": {
      "security": [
        {
          "id": "<scheme-id>",
          "apikey": "$PROVIDER_API_KEY" // will read `PROVIDER_API_KEY` from environment
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

_Replace `<scheme-id>` with the actual security scheme ID defined in the provider JSON document. You can use your own value for `apikey`. However it's a common practice to supply these via [environment variables](#envs)._

## Run in a Node.js app

### Set necessary environment variables

For apps running the capabilities that require authentication, you'll typically want to supply the providers' API keys via environment variables (see [configuration above](#configure-security)).

If you used CLI for configuring the security schemes, the chances are it created `.env` file for you. In that case, simply fill in the environment variables. Then install [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package that will load the `.env` file for you. 

### Write & run the app

If you followed the directions throughout the guide, you should have a project properly configured with a working capability. You can then use Superface OneSDK to simply run it.

```javascript title="app.js" {8,11,12}
// If you're using .env file, you should also install and init `dotenv` package
require('dotenv').config()
const { SuperfaceClient } = require('@superfaceai/one-sdk');

const sdk = new SuperfaceClient();

async function main() {
	const profile = await sdk.getProfile('scope/profile-name');

	const result = await profile
		.getUseCase('UseCaseName')
		.perform(/* Input object as defined in the profile */);

	console.info('Hooray!', result.unwrap())
}

main();

```

_Replace `scope/profile-name`, `UseCaseName` and inputs for `.perform` method with the use case details you actually want to use.<br />For details on SuperfaceClient API, please consult [OneSDK reference](#todo)._

You can then run your app which should perform the use case.

```shell
node app.js
```


### Test the provider map

Since profile & provider are simple descriptions of entities and actions, we don't usually test them. However the maps typically contain non-trivial logic that benefits from being properly tested. In addition, you might want to run integration tests against the provider's sandbox or live servers.

Testing is easy since you simply perform the use case via OneSDK. Then, you test it as any other function. The only difference is that you want to make OneSDK use a specific provider when running in test. You can do that by specifying `provider` parameter inside options for `.perform` method.

See the example of a test written using [`jest`](https://jestjs.io) framework:

```javascript title="profile.provider.test.js" {10,16}
require('dotenv').config()
const { SuperfaceClient } = require('@superfaceai/one-sdk');

describe('scope/profile-name', () => {
  it('should return a result when called with ...', async () => {
    const sdk = new SuperfaceClient();

    const profile = await sdk.getProfile('scope/profile-name');

    const provider = await sdk.getProvider('provider-name');

    const result = await profile
      .getUseCase('UseCaseName')
      .perform(
      	{ /* Input object as defined in the profile */ },
      	{ provider }
      );

    expect(result.isOk()).toBe(true)
  });
});

```


For unit testing all of the Map's logic, you might need to mock the specific responses. We recommend using [`nock`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nock) for this.
