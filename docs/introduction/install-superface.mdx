# Install Superface

Superface CLI is your starting point for working with Superface, from creating your account through all the steps to get your first API use case up and running.

## macOS/Linux

If you have the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) package manager install, Superface CLI can be install by running:

```bash
brew install superfaceai/cli/superface
```

If not, you can install it using [NPM](https://npmjs.org) by running:

```bash
npm install -g @superfaceai/cli@latest
```

## Windows

On Windows, you can install it using [NPM](https://npmjs.org) by running:

```bash
npm install -g @superfaceai/cli@latest
```

Alternatively, if using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you can also install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and install the CLI using that.

## After installing

Once installed, you will be able to use the CLI directly from your command-line by running either the `superface` or `sf` commands.

To get started using the CLI you need a Superface account, you can [create an account](https://superface.ai/create-account) by signing up or running `sf login`.
