# Superface in 5 minutes

Superface is all about providing you the best way to consume digital capabilities provided by APIs.

This guide shows you how to pick a provider, generate Comlinks for the use case you want using the CLI, and use Superface OneSDK to run that use case.

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/) version 18.0.0 or newer installed.

### Pick a use case

This one is up to you. What do you want to achieve?

A use case example would be _"Send an email and include click tracking"_, _"List all the users in a workspace"_, or _"Add users to a specific group"_.

Ultimately, your use case is up to you.

### Pick a provider

The next step is to **pick a provider you would like to use**. Again, this is up to you but we recommend you look for API providers that have Open API Specification versions of their documentation, or that host their documentation with Readme.io.

We've created some Quick Start guides for popular APIs such as [Notion](../api-examples/notion.mdx), [Slack](../api-examples/slack.mdx) and [Resend](../api-examples/resend.mdx).

:::note Provider authentication

In many cases you also need to set up provider credentials. The Superface CLI will inform you about what tokens to add to your development environment. Learn more about how to handle API credentials in [Setting provider API keys](../guides/api-keys.md).

### Install the Superface CLI

Start by insalling the Superface CLI. You can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for this.

```shell
brew install superfaceai/cli/superface
```

If you don't have a Superface account already, you can [sign up here](https://superface.ai/create-account). You can use your account to authenticate the CLI via your browser.

```shell
superface login
```

### Create your Comlinks

The Superface CLI is used to create Comlinks. They handle use case definition, and the map that is used to create the code you need for your app to communicate correctly with the provider you want to work with.

Start by indexing the documentation for the provider you want to use using the `prepare` command:

```shell
superface prepare <URL for provider documentation>
```

Next, create the profile for the use case you want to achieve, for example _"list all users"_:

```shell
superface new <provider-name> "your use case"
```

After this step completes, you can use the profile that was created and turn it into a map that you can use in your application.

```shell
superface map <provider-name> <scope>/<use-case>
```

Don't worry if you don't know what to enter for `<provider-name>` and `<scope.use-case>`, the CLI presents the exact commands you need to run for each step directly in your terminal.

The output from these commands will be a folder named `superface` with the following files:

```shell
superface/
  <provider>.provider.json
  <scope>.<use-case>.profile
  <scope>.<use-case>.<provider>.map.js
  <scope>.<use-case>.<provider>.mjs
  context/
    <provider>.index.json
    <provider>.docs.txt
```

### Install OneSDK

In your app directory, install the OneSDK library:

```shell
npm install @superfaceai/one-sdk
```

### Code

Now you can use OneSDK in your app. Create an `index.mjs` file with the following JavaScript code:

```js title="index.mjs"
import { OneClient } from '@superfaceai/one-sdk';

async function main() {
  const client = new OneClient({
    assetsPath: './superface',
  });

  // Assign our CLI generated profile so it matches
  // the 'name' in the .profile file.
  // Example: email-communication/email-sending

  const profile = await client.getProfile('<profileName>');
  const useCase = profile.getUseCase('<usecaseName>'); // The <usecaseName> is also found in the .profile file

  try {
    const result = await useCase
      .perform(
        {
          // Input parameters as defined in profile:
          <key>: '<value>',
        },
        {
          provider: '<providerName>',
          parameters: {
            // Provider specific integration parameters:
            '<integrationParameterName>': '<integrationParameterValue>',
          },
          security: {
            // Provider specific security values:
            '<securityValueId>': {
              // Security values as described in provider or on profile page
            },
          },
        }
      );

  // output result on success
    console.log("RESULT:", JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));
  } catch(e) {
    // output result on error
    console.log("ERROR:", JSON.stringify(e, null, 2));
  }
}

main();
```

### Run

It's time to run your app! Because the Superface OneSDK is built with WASM, it requires that you pass the `--experimental-wasi-unstable-preview1` flag.

```shell
node --experimental-wasi-unstable-preview1 index.mjs
```

### Check the HTTP communication

Set the environment variable `ONESDK_LOG` to `debug` to see API calls from OneSDK to the API of your chosen provider:

```shell
ONESDK_LOG="debug" node --experimental-wasi-unstable-preview1 index.mjs
```

:::caution

This can print out potentially sensitive information, like API keys and access tokens.

<!--### Understanding runtime integration

During the runtime of the application, OneSDK downloads a Comlink map from Superface servers. The Comlink map instructs the OneSDK how to make the call to GitHub API in order to perform the use case.

OneSDK also downloads the Comlink profile, which contains the definition of the use case for runtime. You can also provide local maps and profiles stored alongside your source code.

You can always check the Comlink map at the profile's detail page for a given provider by clicking the "raw" link. For example here's the [latest map for `vcs/user-repos` and `github`](https://superface.ai/raw/vcs/user-repos.github@2.0.suma).-->
