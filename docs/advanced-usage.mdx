# Configuring the SDK

OneSDK can be used in one of two ways:

- Without configuration: You pass the most essential configuration directly as a function parameter in code. This is ideal for small projects and for trying Superface out.

- With configuration: You configure Superface through a central configuration file or object. This is ideal for larger projects, or when you need advanced features.

As your project grows in size and complexity, you may find it useful to have a central location for configuring details concerning your API integrations.

There are also some features that cannot be used with the simple "config-less" approach (as in [Getting Started](./getting-started.mdx)), namely:

- Using [locally stored profiles, maps and providers](#local); e.g. (yet) unpublished integrations, or integrations with APIs internal to your organization.
- Configuring [provider failover](./guides/using-multiple-providers.mdx#failover).

For these cases, there's Superface configuration.

This configuration can be passed as a `super.json` file (located by default in the `superface` folder under your project root) or as a [full object](#superjson-elsewhere). For example:

```javascript
// If it exists, `super.json` is loaded from `superface/super.json` under project root
const sdk = new SuperfaceClient();
```

For more info on SDK client initialization, see [OneSDK Reference](reference/one-sdk.mdx#configuration). For more info on `super.json` and Superface configuration, see [`super.json` reference](reference/superjson.mdx).

## Getting started with `super.json`

First, install the [Superface CLI](https://github.com/superfaceai/cli).

```sh
# if using yarn
yarn global add @superfaceai/cli
# otherwise
npm install --global @superfaceai/cli
```

Or you can use NPX directly with Superface CLI commands:

```sh
npx @superfaceai/cli [command]
```

### Installing profiles

Installing a profile fixes its version in the `super.json` config file. In the project directory, run:

```shell
npx @superfaceai/cli install <profileName>
```

The CLI creates a configuration file in `superface/super.json`.

### Configuring providers

Next, you configure a provider for the use case:

```shell
npx @superfaceai/cli configure <providerName> -p <profileName>
```

CLI may instruct you about setting up API keys if the provider needs them.

### Conclusion

You should have a `superface/super.json` file now, ready to be tweaked further.
For more info regarding Superface configuration, see [`super.json` reference](reference/superjson.mdx).

This also means you no longer have to keep and pass profile versions in code:

```js
const { SuperfaceClient } = require('@superfaceai/one-sdk');

const sdk = new SuperfaceClient();

async function run() {
  const profile = await sdk.getProfile('<profileName>');

  const result = await profile.getUseCase('<usecaseName>').perform({
    // Input parameters
  });

  console.log(result.unwrap());
}

run();
```

## Loading `super.json` from elsewhere {#superjson-elsewhere}

In some deployment scenarios and environments, it may be inconvenient to rely on the filesystem. For these reasons, it is also possible to load `super.json` in a custom manner:

```javascript
// Custom config loading logic
const superJson = fetchFromMyDatabase('super.json');
const sdk = new SuperfaceClient({ superJson });
```

Misconfigured bundlers may also pose problems, by not including the `super.json` in the resulting output. One solution is to explicitly include the `super.json` in your code, like so:

```javascript
// https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#resolveJsonModule
import superJson from '../superface/super.json';

const sdk = new SuperfaceClient({ superJson });
```
