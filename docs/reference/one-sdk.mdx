# OneSDK for Node.js

OneSDK is a universal API client for Node.js. This page describes OneSDK public API and configuration options.

## Important links

- [OneSDK on GitHub](https://github.com/superfaceai/one-sdk-js) for development and reporting issues
- [OneSDK on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@superfaceai/one-sdk)
- [Getting Started](/getting-started) tutorial

## Installation

OneSDK is available as Node package under the name `@superfaceai/one-sdk`. For installation in a Node.js run:

```shell
npm install @superfaceai/one-sdk
```

## Usage

### Configuration

OneSDK requires a configuration file, by default located in `superface/super.json` path. You can create this file using the [Superface CLI](https://github.com/superfaceai/cli) by installing a profile and configuring a provider:

```shell
npx @superfaceai/cli install <profileName>
npx @superfaceai/cli configure <providerName> -p <profileName>
```

### Initializing the OneSDK client

OneSDK package exports `SuperfaceClient` constructor to initialize an SDK client:

```typescript
import { SuperfaceClient } from '@superface/one-sdk';

const client = new SuperfaceClient();
```

### Performing a use-case (`getProfile`, `getUsecase`, `perform`) {#perform}

With client initialized you can perform the use-cases in installed profiles using the following series of methods:

1. `getProfile('<profileName>')` returns an instance of Profile from the SDK client instance,
2. `getUsecase('<usecaseName>')` returns a use-case from Profile,
3. `perform(input, [options])` executes the use-case with provided input data and optional `options` argument.

```typescript
const profile = await client.getProfile('<profileName>');
const result = await profile.getUsecase('<usecaseName>').perform({
  inputField: 1,
  anotherInputField: 'hello',
});
```

Perform returns a [result object](#result-object).

### Selecting a provider (`getProvider`) {#get-provider}

By default, OneSDK picks the first configured provider or the first provider according to profile's [`priority` array](/reference/superjson#profilesettings) in `super.json` configuration.

You can choose a specific provider for `perform`. Use the `getProvider` method to obtain provider's configuration and pass it into `perform`:

```typescript
const provider = await client.getProvider('<providerName>');
const result = await profile.getUseCase('<usecaseName>').perform(
  {
    // Input parameters
  },
  { provider }
);
```

Read more in [using multiple providers](../guides/using-multiple-providers) guide.

### Handling the result (`Result` type) {#result-object}

The `perform` method always returns a `Result` type that is either `Ok` or `Err`. This follows the [NeverThrow](https://github.com/supermacro/neverthrow) approach. The `Result` type provides multiple approaches for handling the success and error conditions:

#### Conditionals

Use `isOk()` or `isErr()`to check type of result in conditionals.

```typescript
if (result.isErr()) {
  // Result is error, error.toString() returns human readable description of what went wrong
  console.log(result.error.toString());
} else {
  // Result is ok and you can access the result data through value
  console.log(result.value);
}
```

#### Matching a value or error

The `Result` provides a `match` method which accepts two functions. The first function handles the `Ok` result and the the second one handles the `Err` result. The conditionals example above can be rewritten using `match` like this:

```typescript
result.match(
  value => console.log(value),
  error => console.log(error.toString())
);
```

#### Unsafely unwrapping the result

Lastly, you can just use `unwrap` method which will either return a result value, or throw an error.

```typescript
try {
  // Possible error is thrown here and it contains human readable description of what went wrong :)
  const value = result.unwrap();
  // You can access value here
  console.log(value);
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e);
}
```

## Configuration

The Superface OneSDK is configurable through various environment variables:

- `SUPERFACE_SDK_TOKEN` - auth token to enable [integrations monitoring](../guides/integrations-monitoring)
- `SUPERFACE_PATH` - path to the `super.json` configuration file; default is `./superface/super.json` (relative to current working directory)
- `SUPERFACE_API_URL` - URL of the Superface services, useful for SDK development; default is `https://superface.ai`
- `SUPERFACE_METRIC_DEBOUNCE_TIME_MIN` and `SUPERFACE_METRIC_DEBOUNCE_TIME_MAX` - to rate limit metric reporting, OneSDK will send aggregated metrics after at least `MIN` milliseconds and at most `MAX` milliseconds; default is 1000 for `MIN` and 60000 for `MAX`
- `SUPERFACE_DISABLE_METRIC_REPORTING` - set this variable to any value to disable metrics reporting; enabled by default
- `DEBUG` - configures the [debugging output](https://github.com/debug-js/debug); disabled by default, to observe all debug messages relevant to OneSDK set this variable to `superface*`

These can also be passed as configuration parameters during SDK initialization:

```javascript
const sdk = SuperfaceClient({
  // Authenticates with Superface services to enable integration monitoring
  // (Equivalent of `SUPERFACE_SDK_TOKEN`)
  superfaceToken: "string",
  // Disables remote metric reporting, enabled by default
  // (Equivalent of `SUPERFACE_DISABLE_METRIC_REPORTING`)
  disableMetricReporting: false,
  // Configures debugging output, disabled by default
  // (Equivalent of `DEBUG`)
  debug: "", 
  // For cache setup (only disable for now) 
  cache: true,
  // Path to `super.json` or SuperJson object, or undefined
  superJson: undefined,
})
```
