Below is a list of the frequently asked questions we have encountered from users. If you have a question and you don't see it addressed here, please let us know by [sending us a message](./support).

## General

### I was using the older version of Superface, what should I do?

If you were using the previous version of the Superface app, and using our pre-made Comlinks with OneSDK and the CLI, you can continue to do so for the time being. However, we do plan to deprecate the hosted Comlink functionality later this year so we recommend that you move to the latest version of OneSDK sooner rather than later. Find out more about our [suggested approach](./migrate.mdx).

### Is Superface ready for production use?

Superface's OneSDK is currently in beta.

## CLI

Specific questions related to the Superface CLI.
