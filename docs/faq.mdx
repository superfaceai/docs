# FAQ

Below is a list of the frequently asked questions we have encountered from users. If you have a question and you don't see it addressed here, please let us know by [sending us a message](./support).

## General

### I use the older version of Superface, what should I do?

If you were using the previous version of the Superface app, and using our pre-made Comlinks with OneSDK and the CLI, you can continue to do so for the time being. However, we do plan to deprecate the hosted Comlink functionality later this year so we recommend that you move to the latest version of OneSDK and generate your own Comlink profiles from the documentation.

If you want to migrate to the newest Superface but aren't sure how to approach it, [let us know](./support).

### What is the license for Superface?

Superface is licensed under the MIT license. You can check out the specific license details in the Readme for [OneSDK](https://github.com/superfaceai/one-sdk/blob/main/LICENSE), and the [Superface CLI](https://github.com/superfaceai/cli/blob/main/LICENSE).

### Do I need to purchase a license for production use?

No. There is no license required for production use of OneSDK at this time.

### I have questions that aren't answered here, where else can I ask?

You are welcome to reach out to us either through email on support@superface.ai, or head over to [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/superfaceai/discussions) and ask your question there. The team are on hand to help you out.
