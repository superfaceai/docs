# Editing tools

You can edit any custom use cases and tools that you create, as well as add new use cases to some of the ready made tools that Superface offers.

## How to edit a use case

To edit any use cases that you have created head to the [Authoring Hub](https://pod.superface.ai/authoring) in Superface.

There you will see a list of any use cases you have previously created as well as the prompt used to create them.
