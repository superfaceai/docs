# Microsoft Calendar

The Microsoft Calendar tool for Superface allows you to quickly add the following capabilities:

- Create a new event in a user's calendar or the default calendar of a Microsoft 365 group.
- Update the properties of an event object in Microsoft Calendar.
- Retrieve a list of events in the user's mailbox, including single instance meetings and event series.
- Retrieve the properties and relationships of a specified event object. Returns event data in HTML format and supports extensions for custom properties.
- This action allows the organizer of a meeting to send a cancellation message and cancel the event.
