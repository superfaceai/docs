# Salesforce

The Salesforce tool for Superface allows you to quickly add the following capabilities:

- List all the opportunities.
- List all opportunities owned by you.
- Retrieve opportunity detail
- List all leads
- List accounts

## Requirements

You will need a [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/) account to authenticate with Superface.

## Authentication

You must provide the domain name for your Salesforce instance as well as connecting your personal Salesforce account.

### Identifying your domain

When logged into Salesforce, take a look at the address bar of your browser. The URL should look something like `https://superface-dev-ed.develop.lightning.force.com`. The domain you need for Superface is everything that comes after `https://` and before `.lightning.force.com`.

In the example above, the domain would be `superface-dev-ed.develop`.

### Salesforce authentication

Next, you need to connect your Salesforce account by clicking _Sign in with Salesforce_. If you are already signed in you will be redirected to the authentication flow below. If not, you may be asked to log in first.

Check that you are happy with the level of permissions and click on _Allow_.

If the connection is successful you will be redirected back to the Superface tool hub.
