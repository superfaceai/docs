# Create Tools

Superface offers a web based builder named _Authoring_ Hub that uses Open API Specification files to generate tools that you can add to your account for use with your GPT or Agent.

You can launch the Authoring Hub by clicking on _Create Tools_ in your Account menu, or by heading to [https://pod.superface.ai/authoring](https://pod.superface.ai/authoring).

![The authoring hub for tools will be empty until a tool has been started.](/img/tools/authoring-hub.png)

If it is your first time creating a tool, there won't be much to look at.

The first step is to add a _Provider_. This is the Open API Specification for the platform or API you want to connect to Superface.

## Step 1: Add a Provider

Start by clicking on **+ Provider**, a popup will appear and you can either paste an Open API Specification, or provide a URL for one (URLs for documentation hosted by Readme.io will also be accepted here).

![The connect new provider modal](/img/tools/authoring-connect-provider.png)

You don't have to provide a name, however if you want control over the naming you can provide one. Typically the name should be for the service you are creating a tool for (eg. _electricity-maps, hubspot, my-company-api_).

Clicking _Connect Provider_ will index the Open API Specification and get it ready for you to make a tool with. You will see the progress on your screen as well as any errors that may occur.

## Step 2: Check the provider

Once indexing is complete you will be redirected to a page similar to the one below.

![The provider setup](/img/tools/authoring-provider-setup.png)

You can check the setup for the Provider by looking at the JSON output. It outlines:

- The name of the service
- The base URL of the API to connect to
- The security scheme required to connect to the API
- Any additional parameters that are required

If you think anything is missing, you can add the elements you need by using the shortcut templates above the box.

## Step 3: Create a tool

If everything looks correct, it's time to create a tool!

In the _Create new tool_ section you can describe your use case in plain English, and Superface will work out how to achieve it using the Open API Specification you already provided.

For example, this _Electricity Maps_ example, we want to get the latest carbon intensity data for a particular zone, so our prompt can be:

![Shortcut templates are available to help make your provider correct](/img/tools/authoring-tool-prompt.png)

Below the prompt is the provider you want to create the tool with (in this example, it's _electricity-maps_).

### Scopes and names

Superface uses scopes and names as part of the naming convention for the capabilities a tool can offer. You can provide scopes and names if you want, but we will also infer them from the information we have.

In this example, we are looking to get _intensity_ data about carbon use. There are other aspects of carbon data available too, such as _history_ so we could name this tool `carbon/intensity`. Later if we create a tool for historical carbon usage, we can name it `carbon/history`.

![The prompt is filled out and ready to go, using a custom scope/name](/img/tools/authoring-prompt-complete.png)

Click **Create** to create your new tool.

## Step 4: Map

After Superface determines what is required by the API to achieve your use case, you will see a page that looks similar to the one below, with areas for _Profile_, _Map_ and _Provider_.

![The profile only display.](/img/tools/authoring-profile-only.png)

Click on the _Select Provider_ drop down that is highlighted in red. Then select the provider you created earlier. This will then populate the Provider box on the screen.

![The profile and the provider.](/img/tools/authoring-profile-provider.png)

The _Profile_ was created by Superface, based on your earlier use case prompt. It outlines what inputs are required and what the result of a successful run should look like, along with example data that the AI can use to guide users to the correct inputs.

The final step in tool creation is to create a _Map_. This will build a function that will call the API directly to achieve your use case, based on the data in the _Profile_ and the _Provider_.

Click **Map with AI** to start this process.

Again, you will see the progress as it happens, along with any errors.

## Step 5: Install your tool

After the map has been created, your browser will return to the previous screen. The _Map_ section should now be populated.

![The completed profile, map and provider.](/img/tools/authoring-complete-map.png)

Superface now has everything it needs to provide the capability you requested.

Click on **Install** to add it to your list of added tools.

![The tool has now been added to the list of available tools, but it needs one further configuration step.](/img/tools/authoring-tool-added.png)

As you can see in the image above, there is a red dot next to the tool name. This means that there is a piece of configuration missing.

Click on _Config_ to add it and compete the setup.

## Step 6: Configure your tool

Typically, the final step will be to add any authentication information to the configuration for your tool. In this example, an API Key is required.

![The API Key section of the tool config](/img/tools/authoring-final-config.png)

Once the API Key is added, click on _Save Changes_.

![Green is good. This tool is ready to use.](/img/tools/authoring-tool-complete.png)

Green is good! The tool is setup and read for you to use with your GPT, or Agent.
