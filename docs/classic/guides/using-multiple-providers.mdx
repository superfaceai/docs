# Using multiple providers

Consuming a single use case from multiple providers is at heart of Superface.
**You can add as many providers as you need for every profile.**

This guide will walk you through the process of configuring these providers the
way you need them to work. You'll need a Node.js app with OneSDK and a use case set up.
We recommend you to read through the [Getting&nbsp;started](../getting-started.mdx) first if you haven’t done so.

There are currently 2 different ways you might want to switch between the providers:

- [Choose the specific provider for each perform](#manual): fulfill the use case by the chosen provider
- [Setup automatic failover](#failover): switch to another provider when the primary fails

## Manual provider selection {#manual}

In integration scenarios where you need to fulfill the use case by
the specific provider (e.g. because the user content is saved on their servers),
you can manually choose which provider you want to use.

The provider choice is bound to a single perform. This means you can choose
different providers for different `perform` calls.

It works by passing the chosen provider configuration to `perform` method
on the use case. You can fetch the provider configuration in runtime using
`getProvider` method exposed from OneSDK.

### Example {#manual-example}

Let's say your app lists user repositories and you want to support multiple
version control systems. You'd use [`vcs/user-repos`](https://superface.ai/vcs/user-repos)
and will configure all supported VCS providers.

```shell title="cd your-app/"
npx @superfaceai/cli@3 configure github --profile=vcs/user-repos
npx @superfaceai/cli@3 configure gitlab --profile=vcs/user-repos
npx @superfaceai/cli@3 configure bitbucket --profile=vcs/user-repos
```

Then, switching between the 3 configured providers would look like this:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="github"
  values={[
    { label: 'GitHub', value: 'github', },
    { label: 'GitLab', value: 'gitlab', },
    { label: 'Bitbucket', value: 'bitbucket', },
  ]
}>

<TabItem value="github">

```js title="app.js" {8-9,15}
const { SuperfaceClient } = require('@superfaceai/one-sdk');

const sdk = new SuperfaceClient();

async function run() {
  const profile = await sdk.getProfile('vcs/user-repos');

  // Load the specific provider for this perform
  const provider = await sdk.getProvider('github');

  const result = await profile
    .getUseCase('UserRepos')
    .perform({ user: 'superfaceai' }, { provider });

  return result.unwrap();
}

run();
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="gitlab">

```js title="app.js" {8-9,15}
const { SuperfaceClient } = require('@superfaceai/one-sdk');

const sdk = new SuperfaceClient();

async function run() {
  const profile = await sdk.getProfile('vcs/user-repos');

  // Load the specific provider for this perform
  const provider = await sdk.getProvider('gitlab');

  const result = await profile
    .getUseCase('UserRepos')
    .perform({ user: 'superfaceai' }, { provider });

  return result.unwrap();
}

run();
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="bitbucket">

```js title="app.js" {8-9,15}
const { SuperfaceClient } = require('@superfaceai/one-sdk');

const sdk = new SuperfaceClient();

async function run() {
  const profile = await sdk.getProfile('vcs/user-repos');

  // Load the specific provider for this perform
  const provider = await sdk.getProvider('bitbucket');

  const result = await profile
    .getUseCase('UserRepos')
    .perform({ user: 'superfaceai' }, { provider });

  return result.unwrap();
}

run();
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::note

If there's only one provider configured for the profile, that provider is
automatically used and you don't have to explicitly choose the provider in the code.

## Automatic failover {#failover}

When using provider failover, OneSDK will **automatically switch to another
provider in the case of failure**.

This will give you a maximum out-of-the-box resiliency useful for integration
scenarios where you don't care so much about which provider fulfills the use case
but you need it to happen reliably (e.g. in commodity use cases like sending emails, SMS, etc).

### Enabling failover {#enabling-failover}

The failover has to be configured for each use case separately by enabling
`providerFailover` option in the use case defaults.

For example, if you want to send SMS messages reliably, you'll use the
`SendMessage` use case from [`communication/send-sms`](https://superface.ai/communication/send-sms)
and have two or three providers configured.

Then, the configuration of the failover for `SendMessage` use case would look like this:

```json title="superface/super.json" {5-9}
{
  "profiles": {
    "communication/send-sms": {
      "version": "1.0.1",
      "defaults": {
        "SendMessage": {
          "providerFailover": true
        }
      },
      "priority": [
        // ...
      ],
      "providers": {
        // ...
      }
    }
  },
  "providers": {
    // ...
  }
}
```

For more information about the use case defaults, please see
[super.json reference](../reference/superjson#usecasedefaults).

### Specifying failover order {#failover-priority}

By default, OneSDK uses the first provider that was added to the application
as primary, with failover to other providers in order they were added to the app.
You can specify your preferred order in which OneSDK should use and fail over
between the providers.

For example, you're using [`communication/send-sms`](https://superface.ai/communication/send-sms)
to send SMS reliably and have 3 providers configured (e.g. `tyntec`, `plivo` and `twilio`).

You want to primarily use `twilio`. If that fails, you prefer `plivo` and if
the secondary fails as well, you want to switch to `tyntec`.
The configuration of the provider priority for this case would look like this:

```json title="superface/super.json" {10-14}
{
  "profiles": {
    "communication/send-sms": {
      "version": "1.0.1",
      "defaults": {
        "SendMessage": {
          "providerFailover": true
        }
      },
      "priority": ["twilio", "plivo", "tyntec"],
      "providers": {
        // ...
      }
    }
  },
  "providers": {
    // ...
  }
}
```

### Retry on failure {#retry-policy}

By default, OneSDK attempts to perform the use case with each provider **exactly once**.

OneSDK also ships with a configurable
[circuit breaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_breaker_design_pattern)
retry policy. The retry policy has to be configured for each provider by setting
`retryPolicy` option in the use case defaults for provider.

For example, enabling the circuit breaker retry policy for `twilio` when
performing `SendMessage` use case (from [`communication/send-sms`](https://superface.ai/communication/send-sms))
would look like the snippet below.

The default circuit breaker policy makes 5 retries using an exponential backoff
and times out after 30 seconds. For full retry configuration, please see
[super.json reference](../reference/superjson#retrypolicy).

```json title="superface/super.json" {13-18}
{
  "profiles": {
    "communication/send-sms": {
      "version": "1.0.1",
      "defaults": {
        // ...
      },
      "priority": [
        // ...
      ],
      "providers": {
        "twilio": {
          "defaults": {
            "SendMessage": {
              "retryPolicy": "circuit-breaker"
              // ...
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "providers": {
    // ...
  }
}
```

### Failover in code {#failover-code}

When using automatic failover, your code doesn't need to specify anything
about the providers. The priority of providers, their behavior and failover
is configured solely in your local `super.json` file.

For example, using [`communication/send-sms`](https://superface.ai/communication/send-sms)
to send SMS reliably with multiple providers configured using automatic failover,
your application code for performing `SendMessage` would look like this
(note that there's no provider-specific information included):

```js title="app.js"
const { SuperfaceClient } = require('@superfaceai/one-sdk');

const sdk = new SuperfaceClient();

async function run() {
  // Load the installed profile
  const profile = await sdk.getProfile('communication/send-sms');

  // Use the profile
  const result = await profile.getUseCase('SendMessage').perform({
    to: '+123456789',
    from: '+987654321',
    text: 'Really important message!',
  });

  return result.unwrap();
}

run();
```

:::caution

Automatic failover cannot be combined with [manual provider selection](#manual).
