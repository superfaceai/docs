`Verified` - means that the integration code has been verified, tested and published by Superface. This means that the use case is ready to be used in production. If you find any bugs, please report them to [support@superface.ai](mailto:support@superface.ai).

`Unverified` - means that the integration code has been published by someone else than Superface. This means you should be careful when using it in production.

:::note VERIFICATIONS
As we move towards deprecating the previous version of Superface, we are not accepting any verification requests at this time.
