# AI Agent

The Superface AI Agent allows you to interact with SaaS platforms via natural language prompts.

The Agent is based around the same concept of tools as Superface for GPTs, but presents an chat-style interface for you to interact with any API you have connected. The agent enables you to:

- Schedule and re-run tasks.
- Take advantage of a wide selection of pre-built tools for Google, Jira, Zendesk, and others.
- Create new tools for any API using browser a based interface.
