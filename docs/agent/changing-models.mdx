# Changing models

By default Superface uses the _OpenAI ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo_ model, however this may not necessarily be the best model for all the capabilities you want to add with your tools.

You can modify the model that the agent uses by clicking on **Settings > System** and selecting the model you want to run your tools with from the **Foundation model** drop down list.

## Microsoft Azure

You can configure your own privately hosted LLM model in Microsoft Azure by clicking on **Settings > System** and configuring the Microsoft Azure section. This involves configuring the endpoint, key and model of the hosted model in Microsoft Azure.
