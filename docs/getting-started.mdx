# Getting started with Superface 

## How Superface works

  Superface is all about you, the consumer of API capabilities. To get started, first pick a capability and its provider, install it to your application and use Superface OneSDK to make the call.

  Unlike every other API client, **absolutely no API information is hard-coded in your application or the SDK**. 

  The instructions how to make a call are downloaded during your App runtime and resolved by OneSDK to make a **direct HTTP** call to the API. The calls go straight from your App to the provider's API and are **never proxied through Superface**. This lets you change the instructions at runtime without updating or redeploying your app. You can even change providers while it’s running...

  The following steps will guide you how to get started with Superface and OneSDK in 3 minutes.

1. ### Pick a capability
	  
    Decide what capability you would like to use in your application. A capability is described by its profile with unique id. In this guide, we will use the capability **List user repositories of a VCS** like GitHub or Gitlab. It has id `vcs/user-repos`.
    
    <sup>To see detailed description of the capability, check its <a href="https://superface.ai/vcs/user-repos">profile detail page ➚</a>.</sup><br />
    <sup>Discover more <a>capabilties at Superface.ai ➚</a>.</sup>

1. ### Pick provider
	
    The next step is to **pick a provider you would like to use**. In this guide we will continue with `github`. 

    <sup>Find the list of capability providers at its <a href="https://superface.ai/vcs/user-repos">profile detail page ➚</a>.</sup><br />

1. ### Install OneSDK

    In your application directory, install the OneSDK library (`@superfaceai/one-sdk`):

    ```shell
    $ npm install @superfaceai/one-sdk
    ```

1. ### Install capability

    Next, add the `vcs/user-repos` capability to your application using the Superface CLI (`@superfaceai/cli`):
 
    ```shell
    $ npx @superfaceai/cli install vcs/user-repos
    ```

1. ### Configure provider

    The next step is to configure the provider. In our case we configure `github` for capability profile `vcs/user-repos`:

    ```shell
    $ npx @superfaceai/cli configure github --profile vcs/user-repos
    ```

    <sup>In many cases this step may need to setup provider credentials. Since we are using the unauthenticatd GitHub API we can skip it for now. To learn how to authenticate providers check the <a href="#">provider authentication ➚</a>.</sup>

1. ### Code

    Finally, use OneSDK in your Application. Create the `index.js` with the following JavaScript code:
	
    ```js title="index.js"
    const { SuperfaceClient } = require('@superfaceai/one-sdk');
    const sdk = new SuperfaceClient();

    async function main() {
      // Load the capability profile
      const profile = await sdk.getProfile('vcs/user-repos');

      // Invoke the capability use case
      const result = await profile
        .getUseCase('UserRepos')
        .perform({
          user: 'superfaceai'
        });

      // Handle the result
      try {
        const data = result.unwrap();
        console.log(data)
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(error)
      }
    }

    main();
    ```

1. ### Run

    With capability installed, provider configured and OneSDK, it is the time to execute your App:
    
    ```shell
    $ node index.js
    ```

1. ### Introspecting HTTP communication

    Set the environment variable `DEBUG` to `superface:http*` to see what API calls OneSDK makes to GitHub API:

    ```shell
    $ DEBUG="superface:http*" node index.js
    ```

    <sup>Note this can print out potentially sensitive informations. Set the DEBUG value to `*` to see everything what is going in under the hood. Check OneSDK's documentation and source code for more details.</sup>

1. ### Understanding runtime integration

    During the application runtime, OneSDK downloaded Comlink map from Superface servers. The Comlink map instructs the OneSDK how to make the direct call to GitHub API to perform the capability. 

    You can always check the Comlink map at profile's detail page for the given provider.

## Integration monitoring
---

Superface comes with out-of-the box monitoring of your application integrations. With Superface project you will get inst insights in your application's API dependencies and their health status. In the case of use case failure, you will also recieve an email notifications with details about failing API calls.

1. ### Create new project

    Create a new project in your Superface dashboard.

1. ### Get your SDK token

    Copy the project's SDK token. 

1. ### Use the SDK token with your Application

    In command line, set the token as `SUPERFACE_SDK_TOKEN` environment variable:

    ```shell
    $ export SUPERFACE_SDK_TOKEN="your token"
    ```

    Run your application again

    ```shell
    $ node index.js
    ```

1. ### Check your dashboard

    Observe how are the capabilities used by your application.

1. ### Monitor your API dependencies

    In the case of API failure Superface will email you with the notification ....
