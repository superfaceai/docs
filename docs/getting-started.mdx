# Getting started

Superface is all about you, the consumer of API capabilities. To get started, first pick a capability and its provider, install it to your App and use Superface OneSDK to make the call.

:::info

This guide is more detailed version of the in-product [Getting started](https://superface.ai/getting-started) available at superface.ai.

You don't need an account at superface.ai to follow this guide.

## How Superface works

Unlike every other API client, absolutely **no API information is hard-coded in your App or the SDK**.

The instructions how to make a call are downloaded during your App runtime and resolved by OneSDK to make a **direct HTTP call** to the API. The calls go straight from your App to the provider's API and are **never proxied through Superface**. This lets you change the instructions at runtime without updating or redeploying your App. You can even change providers while itâ€™s running.

    Superface registry and the API is called directly from your app.

## Superface in 3 minutes

The following steps will guide you how to quickly get started with Superface and OneSDK.

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/) version 14 or newer installed.

<div class="count-steps-h3">

### Pick a capability

Decide what capability you would like to use in your App. A capability is described by its profile with unique ID.

In this guide we will use the capability **List user repositories of a VCS** like GitHub or GitLab. Its ID is `vcs/user-repos`.

:::note Capability details

To see a detailed description of the capability, check the [`vcs/user-repos` profile page](https://superface.ai/vcs/user-repos).

:::

### Pick a provider

The next step is to **pick a provider you would like to use**. In this guide we will use the `github`.

:::note Additional providers

Find the list of supported capability providers at [`vcs/user-repos` profile page](https://superface.ai/vcs/user-repos).

:::

### Install OneSDK

In your App directory, install the OneSDK library:

```shell
npm install @superfaceai/one-sdk
```

### Install the capability

Next, add the `vcs/user-repos` capability to your App using the Superface CLI:

```shell
npx @superfaceai/cli install vcs/user-repos
```

### Configure the provider

The next step is to configure the provider. In our case we configure `github` for capability profile `vcs/user-repos`:

```shell
npx @superfaceai/cli configure github --profile vcs/user-repos
```

:::note Provider authentication
In many cases you also need to set up provider credentials. Since we
are using the unauthenticated GitHub API we can skip it for now.

To learn how to handle API credentials, see [Setting provider API keys](guides/api-keys.md).

:::

### Code

Finally, use OneSDK in your App. Create the `index.js` file with the following JavaScript code:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

```js title="index.js"
const { SuperfaceClient } = require('@superfaceai/one-sdk');
const sdk = new SuperfaceClient();

async function main() {
  // Load the capability profile
  const profile = await sdk.getProfile('vcs/user-repos');

  // Invoke the capability use case
  const result = await profile
    .getUseCase('UserRepos')
    .perform({
      user: 'superfaceai',
    });

  // Handle the result
  try {
    const data = result.unwrap();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

main();
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### Run

With the capability installed, provider configured, and OneSDK, it is the time to execute your App:

```shell
node index.js
```

}
```

</details>

### Check the HTTP communication

Set the environment variable `DEBUG` to `superface:http*` to see API calls from OneSDK to GitHub API:

```shell
DEBUG="superface:http*" node index.js
```

:::caution
This can print out potentially sensitive information.
:::

Set the DEBUG environment variable to `superface*` to see everything what is going in under the hood.

### Understand runtime integration

During the App runtime OneSDK downloaded a Comlink map from Superface servers. The Comlink map instructs the OneSDK how to make the direct call to GitHub API to perform the capability.

You can always check the Comlink map at profile's detail page for the given provider by clicking the "raw" link. For example here's the [latest map for `vcs/user-repos` and `github`](https://superface.ai/raw/vcs/user-repos.github@2.0.suma).

## Next step

With your first capability set up, you can now [start monitoring the integrations](./integrations-monitoring.mdx) in Superface dashboard.
