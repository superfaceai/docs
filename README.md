# Superface Documentation

The official home of Superface docs.

## Updating the docs

1. ### Run the docs locally
- Clone the repo, then `yarn install` and `yarn start`

2. ### Update the content
- Make your desired changes to the documents inside 
[`/docs`](https://github.com/superfaceai/docs/tree/main/docs) directory<br />
  It uses a standard Markdown syntax, but can be extended with custom React components via MDX.

  <sup>[Help for Markdown features ➚](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features)</sup>

- Put your static content (e.g. images) to 
[`/static`](https://github.com/superfaceai/docs/tree/main/static) directory<br />
  When linking to it from the docs, just drop `/static` from path, e.g. rendering `/img/diagram.png`
  will render an image saved at `/static/img/diagram.png`.

3. ### Update the content structure _(optional)_

- **Page rename, new page, category; or change of structure**<br />
  If you added a whole new category, page or simply want to change the table of contents,
  you'll need to update [`sidebars.js`](https://github.com/superfaceai/docs/blob/main/sidebars.js).
  It uses document IDs that are simply a path to the file minus the extension (unless explicitly
  defined inside the document).

  <sup>[Help for Sidebar ➚](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar)</sup>

- **Changing links in header navigation**<br />
  Navigation links are defined in [`docusaurus.config.js`](https://github.com/superfaceai/docs/blob/main/docusaurus.config.js)
  in `themeConfig.navbar.items` object.

4. ### Get the changes reviewed
- When you're happy with your changes, open a PR and get it reviewed by someone.<br />
_Opening a PR will automatically deploy an online preview of your docs. It also verifies the build
doesn't contain any broken links._

5. ### Deploy to production
- Once your changes are verified and reviewed by another pair of eyes, it is ready to be merged to `main`.<br />
_Merging will automatically deploy `main` branch to production._

  These docs are built using https://docusaurus.io/.

  The site is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to
  [`docs`](https://vercel.com/superface/docs) project.

  All deployments are automated via GitHub Actions and you can keep track of them
  in [the repository's environments](https://github.com/superfaceai/docs/deployments).

  - Preview: gets deployed for each PR
  - Production: gets deployed continuously from `main` branch

  Each deploy first verifies the validity of the build.

  If you'd like to build locally:
